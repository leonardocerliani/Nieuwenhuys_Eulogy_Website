                <p>
                    I became familiar with the work of Prof. Nieuwenhuys early in 2005, during my first internship after my PhD at the Neurological Institute Besta in Milan. There, a friend of mine gave me a copy of an abridged Italian version of his "Human Central Nervous System", a book that every neurologist, neuroradiologist, and neurosurgeon at the Institute was fond of, praising it for the superior clarity of its anatomical descriptions and illustrations, and referring to it daily for their work.
                </p>
                <p>A few years later at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN), while I was working on the insular cortex, my supervisor Prof. Christian Keysers told me I should really talk with the go-to person for every question about neuroanatomy at the NIN. It was a great surprise to discover that he was actually referring to the author of the book that I had been avidly reading and learning from for the past 6 years! More importantly, that started a regular series of professionally and humanly enriching interactions that went on regularly every two weeks for about 2 years. Others have already praised the uniquely valuable experience of working and collaborating with Prof. Nieuwenhuys, therefore here I would like to share a few anecdotes from those interactions that I keep dear in my memories.</p>
                <p>We were meeting around lunchtime in the old library of the NIN, a very narrow room that Prof. Nieuwenhuys had filled with a mountain of books, anatomical tables, specimens. The first question was always the same: an honestly caring "Zo! How are you, dear Leonardo?", with an ensuing conversation of at least 15 minutes filled with stories from his own experience and advice on how to become not only a good researcher, but also a good person. I want to stress this at the risk of going off-topic, because as an academic researcher it happens not infrequently to meet a professionally inspiring fellow scientist, however it is very rare that the same person becomes a source of both professional and human inspiration. I was lucky enough to have this experience three times, and one of them was with Prof. Nieuwenhuys.</p>

                <h3>The Insular Cortex Debate</h3>
                <p>Our first series of meetings were about the insular cortex, as I was working on completing my study on the connectivity of the human insular cortex using probabilistic tractography, and coincidentally Prof. Nieuwenhuys was working on a comprehensive neuroanatomical review of the same brain region. We discussed a lot the issue of a gradual vs. sharp transition of cytoarchitecture in the insula. Prof. Nieuwenhuys was bringing the evidence of sharp boundaries from the classical work of Rose and Brockhaus. Arguing back for a gradual transition, I was replying with the evidence from Von Economo and Mesulam (and even Brodmann!), among many others. After many animated sessions, this querelle des anciens et des modernes turned out to be very fruitful for both of us: he helped me to read the early studies in German - which were useful for discussing my results - and I managed to instill in his thoughts the possibility of a "continuous variation in connectivity along a rostroventral-to-dorsocaudal axis, and that the gradients in the shift of this variation are oriented more or less perpendicular to this axis" <a href="#ref1">(Nieuwenhuys R. 2012)</a>. Far from being a scholastic, splitting hairs discussion, this terminological difference has far-reaching implications for how the insula can be conceived as an integrative region. Having convinced a solid traditional anatomist like Prof. Nieuwenhuys of this possibility reassured me that our results were reliable and added some original findings about the connectivity of the insula.</p>

                <h3>Sketches and the Xerox Ninja</h3>
                <p>As I already mentioned, the room of Prof. Nieuwenhuys at the NIN was filled with papers, books, and drawings about the brain of animals of every species. And every other time I visited him, the amount of living space had been further shrunk by more papers. Contributing to this situation was also the thought process of Prof. Nieuwenhuys: as we started discussing, he would begin drawing anatomy sketches and diagrams (but mostly anatomical sketches) on a sheet of paper, and continue to do so with many other sheets of paper for the next two/three hours. Making drawings and diagrams appeared to be an absolutely essential support of this stream of thoughts - which is actually not surprising for an anatomist, but it was still something amazing to witness in its live unfolding. These were not just temporary mental aids: all the drawings were then carefully ordered, classified, and placed in his own archive. They would reappear weeks or months later when a new discussion required them.</p>

                    <figcaption>Figure 1: Prof. Nieuwenhuys in May 2013, at the time when he was finalizing his titanic effort to compile myeloarchitectonic maps of the human brain. Sections of the maps of Hopf can be seen lying under the iconic map of Brodmann. On the left of the image, close to the agenda, it is visible a reproduction of a map onto semi-transparent paper after manual scaling from the original manuscript using a Xerox machine, in order to overlap it onto other maps for comparisons.</figcaption>

                <p>Related to this, Prof. Nieuwenhuys was not only using hand-drawings to organize his anatomical thoughts. He was also using electronic devices. However, I am not referring to computerized maps and desktop image viewers for drawing regions of interest. No. Much more interestingly, he had tamed a technological device which became popular before the advent of personal computers, and whose advanced functionalities still remain obscure for most of us: the photocopier. As a veteran Xerox Ninja, he had mastered the art of rotating (manually) and scaling (digitally) when copying on semi-transparent papers maps of the same brain regions in different publications, in order to be able to overlay them in a common space and compare them. As a reference for himself, he would write a note in the corner of each copy with the parameters he devised. Throughout the years, he had developed a sensitivity for generating affine transformation matrices in his head, which most of us can only achieve by means of dedicated transformation software. In addition, such collages were not only very efficient, but had also an aesthetic beauty which he always cared about when finalizing the images for his manuscripts.</p>

                <figcaption font-style: italic>Figure 2: During our meetings, we were often joined by a beautiful Chartreux cat that used to lay down close to where Prof. Nieuwenhuys was sitting. Since the space of the (large) table was never enough to lay down the enormous amount of maps that the professor used to consult at once, sometimes he was temporarily using also the space on the carpet.</figcaption>

                <h3>A Final Memory</h3>
                <p>I would like to conclude this recollection with a small episode from the last time we saw each other. We were having some tea in his garden, and he called me to have a look at something. He wanted to show me two small apical branches of a climbing plant. "Look, I have been observing them for a few days, and I noticed that one of the two branches reaches to a location where there is more sun, and thus it can grow better and stronger. The other, instead, is not that 'clever', as it has been curling around all the time, and I am afraid it will die before it finds a way to the sun. I would like to say that the first one has 'more brain', but I cannot find the proper words to respect the nature of this little brainless, but still very intelligent little plant."</p>
